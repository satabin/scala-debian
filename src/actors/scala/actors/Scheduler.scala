/**
 * <p>
 *   The class <code>WorkerThread</code> is used by schedulers to execute
 *   actor tasks on multiple threads.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   !!ACHTUNG: If you change this, make sure you understand the following
 *   proof of deadlock-freedom!!
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   We proof that there is no deadlock between the scheduler and
 *   any worker thread possible. For this, note that the scheduler
 *   only acquires the lock of a worker thread by calling
 *   <code>execute</code>.  This method is only called when the worker thread
 *   is in the idle queue of the scheduler. On the other hand, a
 *   worker thread only acquires the lock of the scheduler when it
 *   calls <code>getTask</code>. At the only callsite of <code>getTask</code>,
 *   the worker thread holds its own lock.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   Thus, deadlock can only occur when a worker thread calls
 *   <code>getTask</code> while it is in the idle queue of the scheduler,
 *   because then the scheduler might call (at any time!) <code>execute</code>
 *   which tries to acquire the lock of the worker thread. In such
 *   a situation the worker thread would be waiting to acquire the
 *   lock of the scheduler and vice versa.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   Therefore, to prove deadlock-freedom, it suffices to ensure
 *   that a worker thread will never call <code>getTask</code> when
 *   it is in the idle queue of the scheduler.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   A worker thread enters the idle queue of the scheduler when
 *   <code>getTask</code> returns <code>null</code>. Then it will also stay
 *   in the while-loop W (<code>while (task eq null)</code>) until
 *   <code>task</code> becomes non-null. The only way this can happen is
 *   through a call of <code>execute</code> by the scheduler. Before every
 *   call of <code>execute</code> the worker thread is removed from the idle
 *   queue of the scheduler. Only then--after executing its task--
 *   the worker thread may call <code>getTask</code>. However, the scheduler
 *   is unable to call <code>execute</code> as the worker thread is not in
 *   the idle queue any more. In fact, the scheduler made sure
 *   that this is the case even _before_ calling <code>execute</code> and
 *   thus releasing the worker thread from the while-loop W. Thus,
 *   the property holds for every possible interleaving of thread
 *   execution. QED
