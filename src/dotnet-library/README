INFO: The dotnet-library tree has been synchronized with
revision 15115 of src/library on $Date: 2008-05-21 14:33:42 +0200 (Wed, 21 May 2008) $.

IMPORTANT:
Never, never, never, ever add/remove/edit files in the dotnet-library
tree by hand. If you need to change sth use the opportunity to merge
the changes that have occured since the last merge. Any manual intervention
makes the merging harder and is to be considerd rude and counterproductive.

HOW TO MERGE:
You can obtain the revision number of the last merge from the commit history
of the tree. Or from the second line of this document. But you should
always check to see if it is consistent with svn log messages.


lamppc26:trunk luc$ svn log -r 15115

Synced src/dotnet-library with rev 15086 of src/library
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Unless you have a specific revision in mind you can check the lates revision
of the src/library tree with

koko:~/scala>svn info src/library/
Path: src/library
URL: https://lampsvn.epfl.ch/svn-repos/scala/scala/trunk/src/library
Repository Root: https://lampsvn.epfl.ch/svn-repos/scala
Repository UUID: 5e8d7ff9-d8ef-0310-90f0-a4852d11357a
Revision: 12880
Node Kind: directory
Schedule: normal
Last Changed Author: mihaylov
Last Changed Rev: 12880
Last Changed Date: 2007-09-17 12:56:57 +0200 (Mon, 17 Sep 2007)


From this we could figure out that we need to merge the changes that happened
between revisions 12365 and 12880 of the src/library tree:

koko:~/scala/src/dotnet-library>svn merge \
https://lampsvn.epfl.ch/svn-repos/scala/scala/trunk/src/library@12365 \
https://lampsvn.epfl.ch/svn-repos/scala/scala/trunk/src/library@12880 ./


(note the ./ at the end of the line specifying the working copy)

You'll get many "Skipped missing target: ..." messages because this tree
only contains files that are different for MSIL. Hopefully, changes in those
files do not introduce anything platform-specific because they will be copied
from the src/library tree. If there are platform-specific changes, the
offending file has to be added to the dotnet-library tree and modified to
compile for .NET.

When you have sorted out the conflicts (by means of manual editing and
'svn resolved'), at the top project directory run

ant msil

to check, at the bare minimum, whether the MSIL subset of the library compiles.
If this is fine, you can commit your changes but make sure that in the commit
message you

 INCLUDE THE REVISION NUMBER WITH WHICH YOU HAVE MERGED!!!!

This is very important because subversion will not keep it for you. And this
number is absilutely necessary for the next merge. Also, you should update
the revision number in this document for consistency.
