/** The canonical builder for collections that are growable, i.e. that support an
 *  efficient `+=` method which adds an element to the collection.  It is
 *  almost identical to `AddingBuilder`, but necessitated by the existence of
 *  classes which are `Growable` but not `Addable`, which is a result of covariance
 *  interacting surprisingly with any2stringadd thus driving '+' out of the `Seq`
 *  hierarchy.  The tendrils of original sin should never be underestimated.
 *
 *  Addendum: of even greater significance is that '+' on mutable collections now
 *  creates a new collection.  This means using AddingBuilder on them will create
 *  a new intermediate collection for every element given to the builder, taking
 *  '+' from an O(1) to O(n) operation.
