This is a fresh start for script tests. The fact that windows exists can
no longer be allowed to stand in the way of testing the wide range of
functionality which currently goes completely untested. So I'll just be
putting self-contained script tests in here to run some way that doesn't
depend on all the platform stars aligning all the time. Feel free to
join me.
